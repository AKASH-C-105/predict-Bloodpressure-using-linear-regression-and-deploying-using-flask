# predict-Bloodpressure-using-linear-regression-and-deploying-using-flask
This project demonstrates how to predict blood pressure levels based on multiple input features (e.g., age)using a Simple Linear Regression Model. The model is deployed as a web application using Flask, where users can input their details and get a predicted blood pressure value in real-time.
